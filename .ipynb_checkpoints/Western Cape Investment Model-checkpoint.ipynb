    "The first question to ask before building a model is what exactly the business objective is. How does the client expect to use and benefit from the model? The objective is important in determining how you will frame the problem, the algorithms to select, the performance measure to use for your model evaluation, and the level of effort you will spend tweaking your model.\n",

    "In this project, you should assume that your model’s output (a prediction of a district’s median housing price) will be fed to\n",
